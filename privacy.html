This privacy policy governs the products and services we offer through our website, mobile applications and other applications (collectively the “Site” or “Houzz Platform”).

            <p>As noted, we work with third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="link-external colorLink">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="link-external colorLink">Google</a>, and others (both <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="link-external colorLink">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="link-external colorLink">Google</a> offer additional ways to opt out of certain advertising activities, and maintain their own privacy policies that address their interest-based advertising services).  We also may work with third parties to display ads on our Site.</p>
            <p>Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested, based upon your activities on our Site and other websites.  These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about members, or allow them to collect certain information through our Site (e.g., IP address and demographic information), but we do not disclose your name, contact information or other personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>You can also manage many opt-out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads from many companies via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="link-external colorLink">aboutads.info</a> choices page or the EU-based <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="colorLink" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>
            <p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the respective opt out pages noted above, will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you based upon your activities on multiple websites, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies, or you subsequently delete your cookies, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the websites listed above.</p>
            <h3>7. Plug-ins and Social Media Widgets.</h3>
            <p>Our Site may include social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook Like button and the "Share this" button, as well as other interactive mini-programs that run both on our Site and Services and on third-party websites, and enable certain features to work (e.g., blogs and comments). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly and for other purposes. When these features are displayed on our Site they are hosted by third parties, and are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
            <h3>8. Pro Pages and Websites.</h3>
            <p>Designers, businesses, retailers and advertisers (“Houzz Pros”), who are independent third parties, may maintain profile pages on the Houzz Platform, and we may host Houzz Pro Websites on or through the Platform (collectively the “Pro Pages”).  Houzz Pros may collect certain information through Pro Pages, and allow you to contact them through their Pro Pages.  Pro’s use of any information collected via Pro Pages, or submitted by you to Pros through the Houzz Platform, is subject to the Houzz Pro’s own policies and practices, and not this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>9. Choice and Access to Your Personal Information.</h3>
            <p>You have certain choices about how to control your data, including publicly displayed profile information, communications settings, network linking, and opting out of tracking by third- parties for certain advertising purposes. These choices are described throughout this privacy policy in the relevant sections.  Further, you may modify any account information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may continue to reside in our systems for a period of time, and we may maintain copies as part of our business records.</p>

            <p>You can close your account at any time by going to account settings. When you close your account, you will cease to provide ongoing or future data to us. Your public profile will be deactivated. However, unless prohibited by applicable law, postings or comments you provided to the Site prior to closing your account, will remain public. We also may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this privacy policy, including a copy of your account information as part of our business records, unless prohibited by law.</p>
            <h3>11. Children.</h3>
            <p>The Site is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

            <h3>12. Security.</h3>
            <p>We have implemented security safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure – so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take certain steps to protect your account and personal information as well, such as by choosing a strong password and keeping such password private, and logging out of your account when you are finished using it.</p>
            <h3>13. International Transfers of Personal Information.</h3>
            <p>The Houzz group is a global organization, headquartered in the United States, with service providers, affiliates and operations in several countries. Your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States (or any other country where we, our affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and service providers operate) and processed there.

You understand that, law enforcement agencies in the United States and these other jurisdictions may access and use your information for the purposes of investigation and law enforcement.
